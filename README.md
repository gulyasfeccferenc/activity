# Online Activity
An online surface the play Activity. The current version is just a beta, the main functions are:
* Timer, to keep up with the actual round (with static 60 sec)
* New word generator (currently from a csv)
* Changeable color schemes (predefined, static)
* Basic cookie handling

Plans for the future:
* Customizable timer (set ticking noise for every second, set alarm few sec before end and when time is up, change time)
* Use some DB for the words, make it available for users to make new lists with words or use predefined ones
* Custom color schemes with dynamic, server-generated css
